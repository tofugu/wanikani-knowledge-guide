WaniKani has a number of different [settings](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/app) related to audio, lessons, and reviews that you can change to suit your preference.

![Audio Settings](/images/audio-settings.png)

**Audio Settings**
* Pick between Kyoko and Kenichi as your default audio voice
* Turn on or off the autoplay option to hear audio during lessons
* Turn on or off the autoplay option to hear audio during reviews
* Turn on or off the autoplay option to hear audio in Extra Study

**Lesson Batch Sizing:** The default number is 5 lessons (individual items) before a quiz. If you want to learn more or less radicals, kanji, or vocabulary before the quiz, you can adjust this anywhere from 3 to 10 lessons.

If you would like to adjust your daily lesson count in “Today’s Lessons”, you can achieve this by changing the lesson batch size. The number of daily lessons in “Today’s Lessons” is 3 times the lesson batch size. For example, when the lesson batch size is set to 5, then the daily lesson count in “Today’s Lessons” will show 15.

**Review Ordering:** The default for this is “Shuffled”, which means that all reviews appear in random order. You can also choose “Lower levels first”, which is still random but prioritizes showing lower level subjects first.

**Lessons & review counts email update frequency:** Here you can choose how often you want to be emailed about your latest lessons and review count: daily, semiweekly, or weekly. Note that this is not a live notification of when you get new lessons or reviews.
