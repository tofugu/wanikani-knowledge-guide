When you're ready to pay for a WaniKani subscription, and you consider [the listed prices](/getting-started/account-and-membership/payment-and-billing/wanikani-premium-membership/), you may be wondering, "how do taxes factor into all of this?"

Listed subscription prices are _pre-tax rates_. Tax or VAT may be added to your total based on region.

You can see the amount of tax added to your purchase on the checkout page before you complete your payment.

After your purchase is complete, you can also view the tax amount on billing invoices and statements.
