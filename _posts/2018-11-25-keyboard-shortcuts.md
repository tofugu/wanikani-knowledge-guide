To make learning and reviewing faster and easier and mouse-less, WaniKani has some keyboard shortcuts.

Check them out:

## Lessons

`W` `A` `S` `D` Slide Navigation _(see below)_ \\
`←` `→` Previous/Next Slide \\
`Enter` Next Slide \\
`G` Skip Item Lesson \\
`Q` Start Quiz (Active when green) \\
`J` Audio Pronunciation

Think of the `W` `A` `S` `D`  keys like the arrow keys but for your other hand. `A` will move you left (aka previous slide) and `D` will move you right (aka forward one slide). For vocabulary lessons that have `Common Word Combinations / Patterns of Use` the `W` key will move up through the different patterns of use, while `S` will move you down.

## Reviews


`F` Open item info \\
`Spacebar` Display hidden item info \\
`J` Play audio (vocab only) \\
`/` Open hiragana IME chart \\
`,` Last session data

And if you'd like to be reminded of what these shortcuts are during your lessons and reviews, there's a shortcut shortcut (hohoho) at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.
