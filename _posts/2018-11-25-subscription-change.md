If you'd like to change your subscription plan you can always do so in your [subscription settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription).

## Monthly to Annual

If you switch from a monthly to an annual subscription, any unused time will be subtracted from the annual price.

## Annual to Monthly

Switching from Annual to Monthly is not possible, unfortunately. You can opt to cancel your Annual sub and wait until the remaining subscription period ends, after which you can make the switch to Monthly.

## Monthly or Annual to Lifetime

If you switch from a monthly or annual subscription to a Lifetime subscription, any unused time will be subtracted from the Lifetime price.
